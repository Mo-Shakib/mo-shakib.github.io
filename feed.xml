I feel both super proud and incredibly grateful for everyone who helped me get here. This whole experience has been a rollercoaster of challenges, new experiences, and memories that Iâ€™ll cherish forever. Looking back, it feels like just yesterday when I packed my bags and left home for Dhaka. That first day in the hostel, I was totally lost and alone. First and foremost, Iâ€™m greatfull to almighty and I want to thank my parents, theyâ€™ve been my biggest supporters, making sure I had everything I needed to succeed. Your unwavering love and encouragement got me through the tough times and kept me going even when things got rough. And I want to thank myself for not giving up, for handling each challenge with grace, and for always trying my best, even when the path seemed overwhelming. To everyone who helped me along the way, whether it was with advice, friendship, or just being there to listen, Iâ€™m so thankful. A big shoutout to my classmates and friends, who made this journey so much fun. Iâ€™ll miss our late-night study sessions, coffee and tea breaks after class, and lunches shared between it all. Those moments made it all so much more than just about grades and assignments. Living in a hostel and later living alone was a huge adjustment. The food wasnâ€™t what I was used to, and I spent more days eating outside than Iâ€™d like to admit. But eventually, I learned to cook out of necessity, and today, I can proudly say Iâ€™m a decent cook! Though the journey wasnâ€™t easy, and I faced a lot of ups and downs, Iâ€™m so proud to be moving forward, ready for the next chapter of my life.</p> <p><strong>Iâ€™m grateful for everything Iâ€™ve learned and everyone whoâ€™s been a part of this incredible chapter ðŸŒ±</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="life-updates"/><category term="graduation"/><category term="gratitude"/><category term="personal-growth"/><category term="university-life"/><category term="memories"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reflecting on my unforgettable undergraduate journey and the people who made it possible]]></summary></entry></feed>
