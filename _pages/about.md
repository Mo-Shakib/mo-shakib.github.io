Hello! I’m Shakib, a recent <b>Computer Science</b> graduate with a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving. Passionate about coding and innovation, I have hands-on experience with various technologies, including `Python`, `JavaScript`, and `C/C++`. My web development expertise extends to `HTML5`, `CSS3`, `Node`, `React`, and Figma, and I’m proficient in Git and GitHub for version control, `SQL` for database management, and applying agile methodologies in software development.

Throughout my studies at BRAC University, I honed my analytical skills and gained hands-on experience through various projects, from developing my personal portfolio site to building a web-based Simon Game. I maintain an archive of my Codeforces solutions, demonstrating my commitment to optimizing code for performance and efficiency. My extracurricular involvement as an executive in the BRAC University Robotic Club enriched my teamwork and event management abilities, while my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles showcase my projects and skills in greater detail.


In addition to my technical pursuits, I contributed as an executive in the Robotics Club at BRAC University, where I helped organize events, gaining experience in teamwork and communication. Outside of academics, I am fluent in English and Bengali and enjoy taking on coding challenges on platforms like Codeforces. Explore my GitHub for a closer look at my work, including my personal portfolio and game projects.
