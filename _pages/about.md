Hellooo! Iâ€™m Shakib, a <b>Computer Science</b> graduate with a solid foundation in programming and a deep passion for problem-solving and innovation. Driven by my love for coding, I continuously explore new technologies and strive to create impactful solutions.

Throughout my studies at [BRAC University](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/), I honed my analytical skills and gained hands-on experience through various projects. My extracurricular involvement as an executive in the [BRAC University Robotic Club](https://www.facebook.com/@BRACU.Robotics.Club/) enriched my teamwork and event management abilities, while my [GitHub](https://github.com/Mo-Shakib) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mo-shakib/) profiles showcase my projects and skills in greater detail.


This portfolio is a comprehensive showcase of who I am, featuring everything from my resume and professional blog to my skills, projects, educational content, and a creative outlet.
